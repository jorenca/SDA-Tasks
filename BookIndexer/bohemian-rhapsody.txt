=== Page 1 ===
Is this the real life?
=== Page 2 ===
Is this just fantasy?
=== Page 3 ===
Caught in a landslide,
=== Page 4 ===
No escape from reality.
=== Page 5 ===
Open your eyes,
=== Page 6 ===
Look up to the skies and see,
=== Page 7 ===
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
=== Page 8 ===
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
=== Page 9 ===
Little high, little low,
=== Page 10 ===
Anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.
=== Page 11 ===
Mama, just killed a man,
=== Page 12 ===
Put a gun against his head,
=== Page 13 ===
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
=== Page 14 ===
Mama, life had just begun,
=== Page 15 ===
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
=== Page 16 ===
Mama, ooh,
=== Page 17 ===
Didn't mean to make you cry,
=== Page 18 ===
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
=== Page 19 ===
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.
=== Page 20 ===
Too late, my time has come,
=== Page 21 ===
Sent shivers down my spine,
=== Page 22 ===
Body's aching all the time.
=== Page 23 ===
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
=== Page 24 ===
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
=== Page 25 ===
Mama, ooh (anyway the wind blows),
=== Page 26 ===
I don't wanna die,
=== Page 27 ===
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
=== Page 28 ===
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
=== Page 29 ===
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
=== Page 30 ===
Thunderbolt and lightning,
=== Page 31 ===
Very, very frightening me.
=== Page 32 ===
(Galileo) Galileo.
=== Page 33 ===
(Galileo) Galileo,
=== Page 34 ===
Galileo Figaro
=== Page 35 ===
Magnifico.
=== Page 36 ===
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.
=== Page 37 ===
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
=== Page 38 ===
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
=== Page 39 ===
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
=== Page 40 ===
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
=== Page 41 ===
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
=== Page 42 ===
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)
=== Page 43 ===
Will not let you go. (Let me go!)
=== Page 44 ===
Never, never let you go
=== Page 45 ===
Never let me go, oh.
=== Page 46 ===
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
=== Page 47 ===
Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)
=== Page 48 ===
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.
=== Page 49 ===
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
=== Page 50 ===
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
=== Page 51 ===
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
=== Page 52 ===
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.
=== Page 53 ===
(Oh, yeah, oh yeah)
=== Page 54 ===
Nothing really matters,
=== Page 55 ===
Anyone can see,
=== Page 56 ===
Nothing really matters,
=== Page 57 ===
Nothing really matters to me.
=== Page 58 ===
Anyway the wind blows.
